                        <p>
                            There isn’t a day that I would not think of you. Every morning I wake up thinking about you and every night I fall asleep to your image in my head. Oh! how sweet it is to be loved and to be in love. You make everything seem bearable, no matter how bad or how hard it is. The thought of you makes me feel at ease. Thank you for being such an inspirational figure that I look upon every single day. You are my light and you are my guide to a happier life. Thank you for choosing me and for being mine. I wish I could see you every day, but it’s okay because the time we are apart compares nothing to the times we are together. See you soon my darling.
                        </p>
